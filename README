+ Draft for R Blog entry on 'grid' new units

  Develop here because only want to add the new blog into 
  R-dev-web/Blog/ once know what day you are going to actually 
  publish (because directories get created based on dates).

  Once ready (and, e.g., TLP happy, and new-units committed to r-devel), 
  move to R-dev-web/Blog/ to check build and publish.

  + add 'bench' to the list of required packages in R-dev-web/Blog/README

+ ./Docker/

  contains set up of docker image to run benchmarks on.

  This is based on https://hub.docker.com/r/rocker/r-devel/dockerfile,
  but, for example, compiles r-devel with '--enable-memory-profiling'
  to provide a fair comparison 
  (because memory profiler slows R down, c.f., 
   https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/utils/html/Rprofmem.html)
  and removes 'COPY checkbashisms /usr/local/bin'

  Build with ...

  docker build -t pmur002/rocker-devel Docker

  Run with ...

  docker run --rm -ti pmur002/rocker-devel /bin/bash

  + Install extra packages

    install.packages(c("bench", "devoid", "ggplot2", "tidyr", "ggbeeswarm"))
    install.packages(c("maps", "mapproj", "Hmisc", "hexbin"))

  + To get files out of running container ...

    # List containers
    docker ps  -a

    # Copy file from container to local dir
    docker container cp ContainerID:/filename1 ./filename2

  + Can also save image from container ...
  
    docker commit ContainerID newimagename

    ... which gives images ...

    grid-new-units-r-3.6.3
    grid-new-units-r-devel

    ... which have the packages installed in R 3.6.3 and R-devel, respectively.
